        I'm a creative person looking at the world as a place full of opportunities. I love learning and acquiring new skills, on many different fields.<br>
                   Through my whole professional life, I've had highly diverse duties, that required lightning fast adaptation and ability to work under pressure.<br>
                   I enjoy good teamwork and I can create a team where there were only single proffessionals.<br>
                   I strongly believe, that there are no unsolvable problems, as long as we can stay calm and act reasonably.
